BUSINESS MODEL:Rough Version

(SMOOTHEN IT OUT)

Customer vendor connection with incentives offered upon healthy life decisions

Could also monitor other health metrics like for eg your cholesterol and if that’s good then offer a deal or some shit

Eg.: Burn x amount of calories, have y% discount at xyz coffee shop/restaurant/Any vendor that joins us (be it restaurants, hotels, cafe, other goods and services)

y% is a function of x, so mathematically price of the good or service offered for free or at a discount will be mathematically integrated to compute the amount of calories one needs to burn.

It will not be something that is related to food in the sense that if a croissant is a 100 calories and you are  eating croissant then, you burn that many calories to get discount with xyz vendor 

The app would be connected to any health app that people might be using like peloton or Apple health, to check the calories people have burnt. Could also be steps taken
Make health metrics the currency for people to get discounts and help them pay for it

Get small scale vendors on board by giving them this app as a platform to advertise their business and gain business

Have big names in the app as well like big food chains etc

Other types of services could be help with homework for any kind just burn x calories or if anything urgent then check other health metrics to motivate students for instance to keep a healthy life style while studying for exams/being at uni. Healthier eating habits will reduce stress levels and depression

Ask people to take surveys once when they join the app asking them how are they feeling mentally/financially/physically and then ask them the same survey after e.g. 2 months of building the app to see if their health levels have improved or lifestyle has improved. 
This would hint towards the fact that the app is improving human health and making profit is just a side effect for us( good for company image) 

Aim U.K. as the main destination to start with

You could also link your calories to credits in classpass
Give money saving stats on app


There is no set rule in how much you can earn. It all really depends on your dedication. The more surveys you answer, the more you earn. Panel websites also organise lotteries, like Panel Opinion who has a monthly VIP draw to win £250. Typically a survey will pay £0.50 for 10 minutes.

The calories that a user needs to burn to achieve rewards are decided on the basis of their BMR (IT’LL BE A CHALLENGE TO NOT GET SCAMMED AND GET PEOPLE’S ACTUAL BMR since nothing’s stopping them from entering lower bmr)


CONVERTING CALORIES TO CURRENCY = convert kcal to joule, or to KWh, which are units of energy that are regularly monetised. You can use that for conversion. 




TODO (unordered):

1. Set up user accounts:
    1. Credentials
    2. Devices connected
    3. Health metrics display
    4. Total credits earned/spent/remaining
    5. Credit spend logs
2. Create an api connection to smart watch
    1. Get health metrics:
        1. Step count/calories/heart rate etc
3. Set up vendors on the app
    1. Deliveroo/uber eats like display
    2. 
4. Track calories that have been burning in a day
5. Convert to joules
    1. Convert joules to credits
    2. Internally convert credits to local currency that will be shared with vendors
  



Other ideas::

Personalized Baselines: Instead of having a fixed standard for everyone, the app could establish personalized baselines for each user based on their age, weight, height, and other relevant factors. This way, the currency earned would be relative to their own capabilities and efforts.

Intensity and Duration Factors: To account for variations in activity levels, you can introduce factors such as intensity and duration. For example, higher-intensity activities or longer durations could earn more currency compared to lower-intensity or shorter activities. This approach acknowledges the additional effort put in by individuals like professional athletes.

Balanced Metric Weighting: Instead of focusing solely on a single metric like calories or steps, you can consider a combination of multiple metrics to determine the currency earned. This could involve factors like calories burned, steps taken, active minutes, heart rate zones, and so on. By considering various aspects of fitness, the app can reward users based on a holistic view of their activity.

Challenges and Achievements: Implementing challenges and achievements within the app can further motivate users. These can be tailored to individual capabilities, allowing users to set realistic goals and earn currency upon completing them. This way, it becomes more about personal progress rather than direct comparisons between users.

Social Engagement: Creating a social aspect within the app, such as leaderboards or group challenges, can foster healthy competition and a sense of community. Users can compare their progress and achievements with others in similar fitness levels, providing an additional incentive to earn currency and stay active.
